# Contact Form Backend Setup

## Overview
The contact form has been successfully integrated with a Convex backend to store and manage messages.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend Functions (`convex/contact.js`)
- **`submitContactForm`**: Handles form submissions with validation
- **`getMessages`**: Retrieves all messages for admin dashboard
- **`updateMessageStatus`**: Updates message status (new/read/replied)

### 2. Frontend Integration (`contact.html`)
- Real-time form validation
- Loading states during submission
- Error handling and user feedback
- Connected to production Convex deployment

### 3. Admin Dashboard (`admin.html`)
- View all contact form messages
- Mark messages as read/replied
- Real-time status updates
- Responsive design matching your portfolio theme

## How It Works

### For Users (Contact Form)
1. Fill out the contact form on `contact.html`
2. Form validates input (name, email, message required)
3. Data is sent to Convex backend and stored in database
4. User receives confirmation message

### For Admin (Dashboard)
1. Access `admin.html` to view all messages
2. Messages are displayed with sender info, date, and content
3. Use buttons to mark messages as "read" or "replied"
4. Refresh button to load latest messages

## Database Schema
Messages are stored with the following fields:
- `name`: Sender's name
- `email`: Sender's email
- `phone`: Sender's phone number
- `subject`: Message subject
- `message`: Message content
- `status`: Message status (new/read/replied)
- `timestamp`: Submission timestamp

## URLs
- **Production Backend**: `https://sincere-blackbird-436.convex.cloud`
- **Development Backend**: `https://amicable-elephant-156.convex.cloud`
- **Admin Dashboard**: `admin.html`

## Testing
The contact form has been tested and is working correctly. You can:
1. Submit a test message through the contact form
2. View it in the admin dashboard
3. Update its status

## Security Features
- Email format validation
- Required field validation
- Server-side validation in Convex functions
- No sensitive data exposure in frontend

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Email Notifications**: Set up email alerts for new messages
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam submissions
3. **File Attachments**: Allow file uploads
4. **Message Search**: Add search functionality to admin dashboard
5. **Export Messages**: Add CSV export functionality

## Maintenance
- Messages are stored in Convex database
- No additional server maintenance required
- Convex handles scaling and backups automatically
